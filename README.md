## What is 5Min?

**5Min** is a fully automated trading bot that monitors, enters, and manages positions on **BTC 5-minute prediction markets** on Polymarket. It runs a multi-rule trend-following strategy — buying UP or DOWN tokens based on real-time price movement — and lets you run **live trading and paper (simulated) trading simultaneously**, all controlled through a Telegram bot.

---

## Features at a Glance

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| 📡 | **Auto market discovery** — polls Gamma API for active BTC 5-minute markets |
| ⚡ | **Dual-mode** — live and paper trading run in parallel on the same price feed |
| 🧠 | **4-rule decision engine** — trend-following logic with dynamic position sizing |
| 📉 | **Size reduction near expiry** — automatically scales down orders as markets close |
| 💬 | **Telegram dashboard** — real-time alerts, trade logs, P&L, and bot controls |
| 🗄️ | **SQLite paper analytics** — full session history and performance tracking |
| 🛑 | **Graceful shutdown** — archives sessions and notifies on exit |

---

## Strategy

Every tick, the bot reads price history for each active market and runs a decision engine across five rules:

```
R0 — Size Reduction     If time_remaining < SIZE_REDUCE_AFTER_SECS → scale down order size
R1 — No Position        UP rising → Buy UP   |   DOWN rising → Buy DOWN
R2 — UP Only            Lock with DOWN if cost/pair is profitable, or expand if DOWN is lagging
R3 — DOWN Only          Lock with UP if cost/pair is profitable, or expand if UP is lagging
R4 — Both Sides         Lock the weaker side, or expand the side with rising trend & lagging PnL
```

> Trend detection uses a rolling window of price history. A side is "rising" when the latest price exceeds the oldest and up-moves outnumber down-moves.
